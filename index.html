    <p><a href="http://github.com/JamesEarlDouglas/xsbt-web-plugin"><strong>xsbt-web-plugin</strong></a> is my port of sbt-web-plugin to new version of sbt(called xsbt during reconsideration of it’s API and configuration approaches). xsbt-web-plugin is a plugin for web development used now by pretty much everyone who’s doing webdev in Scala</p>

    <p>Ported original plugin in order to play with Lift on new version of sbt. Later reworked it to support multiple context deployments and multiple servers running at the same time which became version 0.2</p>

    <p>I transferred it’s maintenance to James since I don’t have time to care of it since middle of 2012</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://github.com/adamw/xsbt-proguard-plugin"><strong>xsbt-proguard-plugin</strong></a> is a work similar to xsbt-web-plugin. Just wanted a uber jar packaging for xsbt and made it myself</p>
